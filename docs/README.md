# README

In order to run all relevant files install the code environment via requirements.txt
The preprossesing of the data is done in the training jupiter notebook.
We separatley list it in the preprocessing jupiter notebook file for external usage.
All anomaly detection using clustering is in the anomaly_detection jupiter notebook
Here is all the cluseting on embeddings from the raw data as well as the hidden states of the LSTM model.
Both in in the times_series and data_exploration jupiter notebook we do extensive analysis on the data
and visualize important aspects.
In the metric_engineering file we have a theoretical rundown of the metrics that we used.
