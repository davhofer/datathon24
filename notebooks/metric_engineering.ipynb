    "1. Engagement\n",
    "- defined as what a user does with the post, i.e. comment and like. \n",
    "- engagement rate: percentage of engagement with respect to audience\n",
    "    - audience is technically *everyone* who views the post, but easier to define: number of followers\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Reach\n",
    "3. Audience Growth Rate\n",
    "- new followers within a time frame\n",
    "- growing audience implies brand is growing\n",
    "- percentage of total audience\n",
    "    - i.e. growing 100 new followers from 1000 followers (10%) is a bigger deal than adding 100 new followers to 10k followers. \n",
